                            <p>I volunteered with a local elementary school in high school to teach computer
                                science to third and fourth graders for 30 mins once a week. As part of my senior
                                capstone project, I created a 'video game bootcamp' curriculum and taught that three 
                                times a week. It was really cool to see the kids get excited about computer science.
                                I was also able to pass my curriculum along to their teachers, and one of them still
                                teaches coding today.

                            <p>As part of Intern Day, I had the opportunity to participate in the Giving Program
                                at Microsoft. I chose to volunteer to paint benches as part of an initiative known as 
                                Buddy Bench. The goal of the bench is to help kids who are shy or lonely reach out and
                                find friends to play with.

                            <p>I started a mentorship program for Aggie Women in Computer Science. My goal was to pair 
                                underclassmen women with upperclassmen who have experience in not only CS classes, but 
                                the culture and environment of the workplace. The program kicked off this year with 25 mentorship
                                pairs. I hope that this program can grow over time and encompass freshman women who have not
                                yet decided whether they want to go into computer science to give them a sense of community.
