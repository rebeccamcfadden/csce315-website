                    <div class="wrapper">
                        <p>
                            I am a sophomore at Texas A&M majoring in
                            computer science with a minor in embedded system design. I am an officer for the
                            A&M branch of <a href="https://women.acm.org/">ACM-W</a>, Aggie Women in Computer Science (<a href="https://www.awics.org">AWiCS</a>) and I am involved in
                            many other students groups on campus, such as Dance Arts Society and Hullabaloo Band.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Outside of school, I enjoy <a
                                onmouseover="hover('images/painting.jpg');" onmouseout="unhover();">painting</a>,
                                reading,
                            cooking/baking, <a onmouseover="hover('images/dance.jpg');"
                                onmouseout="unhover();">dance</a>, and
                            tinkering with Raspberry Pis.
                            Though all of those are generally indoor activities, I like to spend a fair amount of time outdoors, whether
                            that be running, <a onmouseover="hover('images/seattle.jpg');" onmouseout="unhover();">hiking</a>, or just
                            sitting by the pool at my apartment.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            After I graduate, I hope to move back to my home area of Washington D.C. or along the East Coast to spend more time 
                            with <a onmouseover="hover('images/family.jpg');" onmouseout="unhover();">my family</a>.
                            While I don't have a specific company or focus area in computer science that I'd like to pursue at this time,
                            I hope to work on a project or team that showcases the "magic" of technology to the world. I came to computer science 
                            from aerospace/mechanical engineering because I was inspired at a young age by theme park attraction design and animatronics.
                            As I got older, that fascination found a new subject in the form of space travel after having witnessed the final fly-in of the
                            <a onmouseover="hover('images/discovery.jpg');" onmouseout="unhover();">Discovery space
                                shuttle</a> to Washington Dulles Airport and working at the Air and Space Museum in DC. Yet
                                when I started taking
                            college classes, I found my interest pulled by
                            my computer science minor classes and I eventually made the switch. Therefore, my goal is to find a job that combines my 
                            inspirations with the field I enjoy.
