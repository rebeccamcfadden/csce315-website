                <h3>
                    My name is Rebecca McFadden.
                </h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I am from the Washington D.C. area. I am a sophomore at Texas A&M majoring in
                    computer science with a minor in embedded system design. I am an officer for the
                    A&M branch of ACM-W, Aggie Women in Computer Science (AWiCS) and I am involved in
                    many other students groups on campus, such as Dance Arts Society and Hullabaloo Band.</p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Outside of school, I enjoy painting, reading, cooking/baking, dance, and tinkering with Raspberry Pis.
                    Though all of those are generally indoor activities, I like to spend a fair amount of time outdoors, whether
                    that be running, hiking, or just sitting by the pool at my apartment.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    After I graduate, I hope to move back to the East Coast to spend more time with my three siblings and my family. 
                    While I don't have a specific company or focus area in computer science that I'd like to pursue at this time,
                    I hope to work on a project or team that showcases the "magic" of technology to the world.
