                        <h3>AI Platform Explore Intern, Microsoft</h3>
                        <p>During the summer of 2019, I worked as an Explore Intern with Microsoft's Azure AI Platform team. I collaborated with
                        two other interns to develop documentation for deploying <a href="https://www.kubeflow.org/">Kubeflow</a> on Azure.
                        Kubeflow is an open-source Kubernetes toolkit, originally developed by Google, for containerizing ML models. My team and
                        I built sample pipelines to showcase how the Azure ML Python SDK could be utilized to train, register, and deploy ML
                        models using Kubeflow on Azure. We created and helped to launch the <a
                            href="https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/azure/">official Kubeflow documentation page</a> for deploying on Azure. In
                        addition, we were invited to and spoke at Google's Kubeflow Doc Sprint, where we contributed to the redesign of their
                        landing page.</p>
                        <h3>Student Researcher, Texas A&M <a href="https://ecologylab.net/">Interface Ecology Lab</a></h3>
                        <p>In the spring of my freshman year, I joined the Interface Ecology Lab at Texas A&M as a web developer and student
                        researcher. Our focus was developing <a href=https://livemache.ecologylab.net/> LiveMache</a>: a collaborative ideation
                            platform. LiveMache is used in some Texas A&M and other universities’ classes to support co-creation and interactive
                            design projects. It is infinitely zoomable and allows dragging and dropping many types of media, such as videos,
                            photos, PDFs, and even video chat. I worked to implement new features and bug fixes in HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
                            Most recently, I worked on overhauling the touch interactions and implementing pinch zooming capabilities.</p>
                        <h3><a href="https://airandspace.si.edu/support/get-involved/student-jobs">Explainer</a>, National Air and Space Museum</h3>
                        <p>My junior year of high school, I began a volunteer position at the National Air and Space museum in Washington D.C. as
                        an Explainer. The Explainer program hires high school and college students to teach science demonstrations and answer
                        questions from visitors. High school students are required to complete a 100 hour volunteer position before they can be
                        considered for the paid position. Once I completed these hours, I was hired as a part-time Explainer. I stayed with the
                        program until winter break of my freshman year of college. Through this program, I met astronauts, worked a booth at
                        D.C.’s Awesome Con, and got to go to work every weekend and inspire so many young people to learn more about our world.
                        I feel blessed to have had such an incredible first part-time job and to have gotten to experience all the things I did.</p>
